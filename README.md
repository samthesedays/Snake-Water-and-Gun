# Snake-Water-and-Gun
A fun randomized luck based arcade game made with Python to reinculcate the definition of "Rock,Paper and Scissors".
# You will be playing against the computer and the object drawn by the computer is completely randomized so do not fear rigging.
# This game has been made for fun and for entertainment purposes only and please do not spread hate because this has been made by a beginner.


Rulebook:
#1 If snake is drawn and the opponent draws water, you will win because the snake will drink the water.
#2 If water is drawn and the opponent draws gun, you will win because the gun will be ruined by water.
#3 If gun is drawn and the opponent draws snake, you will win because the snake will die to the gun.
